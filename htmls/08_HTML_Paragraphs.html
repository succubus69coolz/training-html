<!-- The Poem Problem -->
<p>In HTML, spaces and new lines are ignored:</p>

<p>

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.

</p>

<!-- The HTML <pre> Element -->
<p> The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks:</p>

<pre>
   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

   My Bonnie lies over the sea.

   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
   
   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
